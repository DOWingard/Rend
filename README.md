# VOID REND Prototype 

3 knobs, 1 switch.

Swell = main gain/max + brings in light distortion [**broken mode**: increased distortion]
Sheer = distortion drive [**broken mode**: even more drive and hard clipping threshold]
Mangle = Texture + filtering to be implimented [**broken mode**: fuck up the whole sound]
ClickMe = switch to **broken mode**

Sound is still getting dialed in and **broken mode** is supposed to switch the faceplate to a dark shattered one so thats a future derek problem but this plugin is getting fucking dialed in. I am compparing it against others I have and tuning it to really compete with some good ones.
